Spatially Infromed Artificial Intelligence. A deep learning method for identifying Spatially Predictive Genes from spatial transcriptomics data.

1. Prerequisites
2. Input Data Format

For each spatial transcriptomics experiment, a directory should be created as [experiment_name]/Processed_Data/
Within the directory should be a spot by counts matrix and a coordinates matrix with spots as rows and coordinates as columns.
